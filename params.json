{"name":"Pocketinveditor","body":"A [Minecraft Pocket Edition](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe) inventory editor for Android.\r\n\r\nThis project uses the [SpoutNBT](https://github.com/SpoutDev/SpoutNBT) library.\r\n\r\n### Compiling ###\r\n\r\nPocketInvEditor is structured so that code common to both the free and the Pro version\r\nis included in the PocketInvEditor library project, while code for only the free version\r\ngoes into the PocketInvEditor_app project.\r\n\r\nBuilding with the Ant buildscript from the Android SDK:\r\n\r\n1: git clone https://github.com/zhuowei/PocketInvEditor.git\r\n\r\n2: git clone https://github.com/zhuowei/PocketInvEditor_app.git\r\n\r\n3: cd PocketInvEditor_app\r\n\r\n4: (optional) ./builtfor_amazon.sh or ./builtfor_play.sh # this changes the app market link in the About menu - the default goes to Google Play\r\n\r\n5: ant clean debug install\r\n\r\n6: ???\r\n\r\n7: Profit!\r\n\r\nPocketInvEditor depends on an old version of SpoutNBT, which is included with this repository in the libs folder. \r\n\r\nI have not tested building with Eclipse; however, if you open PocketInvEditor_app,\r\nadd PocketInvEditor as a library project, and add the spoutnbt-1.0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar to\r\nyour classpath, it probably would build in Eclipse.\r\n\r\n","tagline":"A inventory editor for Minecraft PE on Android","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
